# PokerStarHandAnalyzer
Scrapes hands from hand history from pokerstars and anazlyzes them

For now, the tool only puts all played hands in the database. You have to access the database manually. 

Work is still (slowly) progressing. I aim to be able to obtain various stats about your play with this tool.
In the future, playing back any desired hand and seeing what were the optimal decisions should also be possible.
